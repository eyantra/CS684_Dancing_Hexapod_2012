Problem Statement:
----------------------------
	In our project, we designed an autonomous dancing hexapod, a Hexapod which will dance to 
any song played. The user has to play any song on his Android based phone, and the hexapod will dance 
according to the song played. The Android phone will communicate wirelessly with the hexapod using 
bluetooth.
